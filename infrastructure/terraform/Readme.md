There's a bunch of shit in here that doesn't really work. kubespray was something I looked at and am *not* currently using. terraform-inventory is something I'll probably look into at some point to use for ansible. Right now, ansible and terraform keep duplicate inventories.

There's a little venv.sh script for making a python environment here.
